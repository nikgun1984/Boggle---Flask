# FLASK-BOGGLE

> [***Boggle***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a word game invented by  
Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers.   
I used ***Flask Framework/Python*** for back-end to receive requests and. 
send responses back to the browser, ***JS/Jquery/Axios*** for front-end to send requests to the server.  
Using sessions the game will keep the best scores, number of games played. There is an option to select board dimensions.
